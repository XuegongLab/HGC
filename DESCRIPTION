Description: HGC (short for Hierarchical Graph-based Clustering) is an R package for 
        conducting hierarchical clustering on large-scale single-cell RNA-seq 
        (scRNA-seq) data. The key idea is to construct a dendrogram of cells on 
        their shared nearest neighbor (SNN) graph. HGC provides functions for 
        building graphs and for conducting hierarchical clustering on the graph. The 
        HGC.core package is the skeleton of HGC and it constains only clustering 
        functions.
