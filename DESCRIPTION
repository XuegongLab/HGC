Description: HGC (short for Hierarchical Graph-based Clustering) is an R package for 
        conducting hierarchical clustering on large-scale single-cell RNA-seq 
        (scRNA-seq) data. The key idea is to construct a dendrogram of cells on 
        their shared nearest neighbor (SNN) graph. HGC provides functions for 
        building graphs and for conducting hierarchical clustering on the graph. The
        users with old R version could visit

        built for R 3.6.
