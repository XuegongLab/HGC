# The plotting guide for the R package HGC.

## Introduction

The files are the supplement for the R package `HGC`. There are three main files saved as notebooks.

### Preparation_For_Demo_Data

We produce a demo clustering tree from a simulation dataset. The file records the data preprocessing, dimension reduction and graph construction steps by `Seurat`, and clustering by `HGC`. The result is saved in the folder DemoData.

### Plotting_Dendrogram_And_Low_Dimension_Visualization

We collect several ways to visualize the cluster trees with R packages. And we provide the notes to unify the colours in plotting the dendrogram and visualizing the data in low dimensions.

### Loading_Different_Graphs

The file includes the methods to load graphs from `Seurat` and `monocle3`.
